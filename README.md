## Project Description
  The aim of this project is to create a Christmas story that runs in the command promt of C++. To do this and to make the story as interactive as possible, we have included  ASCII art in place of graphics, delays in between text in place of a UI and an interactive panel where the user can choose to run one of the tools available.
  
### Tools Available
#### Father Christmas Geolocator & Christmas Countdown
  In this tool the user depending on whether it is December or Christmas day chooses either the geolocator or the countdown. If they choose the geolocator option our algorithm calculates the approximate location of Father Christmas delivering presents based on the time of day. On the other hand, the countdown retrieves the date from the computer OS and then calculates the days left until Christmas day.
  
#### Naughty List 
  This tool based on new technological advances in phone tracking software. It decides whether someone has been good or naughty this year and then transmits this information to the North pole.
